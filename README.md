#### By _**By Jamal**_

## Description

_This is a basic calculator being built as part of an exercise on Epicodus. It will serve as the practice lesson for skills taught and will mainly be used to help confirm comprehension of front-end/user-interface logic and back-end/business logic. Basically the intent is to gradually build a functioning calculator._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

### To add this file to your personal computer

* _Open your Git Terminal._
* _Go to your Desktop folder (or any other folder you have choosen; take note that it is important not to clone one project into another projectâ€™s folder) by using the `cd Desktop` command in the Terminal._
* _Get a copy of the link on github.com or copy it from here- https://github.com/jamalss/calculator_
* _In the Terminal window type in `git clone` plus the web address like this- `git clone https://github.com/jamalss/calculator`. This clones the calculator folder to your computer's Desktop or whatever folder you have chosen to place it in._
* _Type `ls` in the Terminal window and you should see your project folder appear._
* _Go into that project folder in the Terminal using the `cd` command._
* _Type in `git log` to confirm that you are in the project folder and can see all of the git commits from the previous work on this project. (If this list of commits is long, you may have to press `q` to get back to the command line prompt)._
* _Type `git remote -v` and you should see a remote link nicknamed origin to your remote repository url. (Whenever we clone a project from GitHub the repository we cloned from is automatically included as a remote named origin)._
